# clock-widget

This is my fork of the analog clock widget in KDE Plasma 5. I was disappointed with the lack of customizability in the clock settings, so I made my own.

##### Note: This is currently not customizable. This is just the set of files I plan on working with.

### Install
Change your directory to wherever you downloaded the repository and run:
`plasmapkg2 --install customclock`
then the widget should appear in your widgets sidebar.
